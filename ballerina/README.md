## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage marketing, sales, customer service, and content management through an integrated suite of tools designed to grow better.

The `ballerinax/hubspot.crm.associations` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [HubSpot CRM Associations API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/associations) endpoints, specifically based on [HubSpot CRM Associations API v4](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/associations).
## Setup guide

To use the HubSpot CRM Associations connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a [HubSpot developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/) and obtain an API access token. If you do not have a HubSpot account, you can sign up for one [here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm).

### Step 1: Create a HubSpot Account

1. Navigate to the [HubSpot website](https://www.hubspot.com/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. Note that while HubSpot offers a free CRM tier, certain API features and higher rate limits may require a Professional or Enterprise subscription plan depending on your usage requirements.

### Step 2: Generate an API Access Token

HubSpot uses Private Apps to generate access tokens for API authentication. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your HubSpot account.

2. In the main navigation bar, click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the top right corner.

3. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to **Integrations** > **Private Apps**.

4. Click **Create a private app**.

5. On the **Basic Info** tab, enter a name and description for your app.

6. Navigate to the **Scopes** tab and select the required scopes for CRM associations (e.g., `crm.objects.contacts.read`, `crm.objects.contacts.write`, `crm.objects.companies.read`, `crm.objects.companies.write`).

7. Click **Create app** in the top right corner, then click **Continue creating** to confirm.

8. Once created, your access token will be displayed. Click **Show token** to reveal it.

> **Tip:** You must copy and store this key somewhere safe. It won't be visible again in your account settings for security reasons.
## Quickstart

To use the `HubSpot CRM Associations` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

```ballerina
import ballerina/oauth2;
import ballerinax/hubspot.crm.associations as hscrmassociations;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and configure the obtained credentials:

```toml
clientId = "<Your_Client_Id>"
clientSecret = "<Your_Client_Secret>"
refreshToken = "<Your_Refresh_Token>"
```

2. Create a `hscrmassociations:ConnectionConfig` and initialize the client:

```ballerina
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string refreshToken = ?;

final hscrmassociations:Client hscrmassociationsClient = check new ({
    auth: {
        clientId,
        clientSecret,
        refreshToken
    }
});
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Create associations between objects

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    hscrmassociations:BatchInputPublicAssociationMultiPost newAssociations = {
        inputs: [
            {
                'from: {
                    id: "12345"
                },
                to: {
                    id: "67890"
                },
                types: [
                    {
                        associationCategory: "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
                        associationTypeId: 1
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    };

    hscrmassociations:BatchResponseLabelsBetweenObjectPair response = check hscrmassociationsClient->/associations/["contacts"]/["companies"]/batch/create.post(newAssociations);
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
