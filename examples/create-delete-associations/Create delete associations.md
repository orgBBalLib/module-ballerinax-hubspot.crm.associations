# Create and Delete Associations

This example demonstrates how to manage associations between HubSpot CRM objects (deals and companies) using the HubSpot CRM Associations connector. The script creates default associations, creates associations with custom labels, reads associations, and then deletes them both specifically and completely.

## Prerequisites

1. **HubSpot Setup**
   > Refer to the [HubSpot setup guide](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.associations/tree/main/ballerina/Package.md) to obtain OAuth2 credentials.

2. **Configuration**
   Create a `Config.toml` file in the project root directory with your HubSpot OAuth2 credentials:

   ```toml
   clientId = "<Your Client ID>"
   clientSecret = "<Your Client Secret>"
   refreshToken = "<Your Refresh Token>"
   ```

3. **Update Object IDs**
   Before running the example, update the following constants in `main.bal` with valid HubSpot object IDs from your account:
   - `FROM_OBJECT_ID` - A valid deal ID
   - `TO_OBJECT_ID` - A valid company ID

## Run the Example

Execute the following command to run the example. The script will print its progress to the console, showing the results of each association operation.

```shell
bal run
```

The script will perform the following operations in sequence:
1. Create a default association between a deal and a company
2. Create an association with a custom label (USER_DEFINED, associationTypeId: 3)
3. Read all associations between the deal and company
4. Delete the specific labeled association
5. Read associations again to confirm deletion
6. Delete all remaining associations between the deal and company
7. Read associations one final time to confirm complete removal
