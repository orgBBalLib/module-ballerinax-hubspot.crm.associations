# Create Delete Associations

This example demonstrates how to manage associations between HubSpot CRM objects (deals and companies) using the HubSpot CRM Associations connector. The script creates default associations, creates associations with labels, reads associations, and then deletes specific and all associations between the objects.

## Prerequisites

1. **HubSpot Setup**
   > Refer to the [HubSpot setup guide](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.associations/tree/main/ballerina/Package.md) to obtain OAuth2 credentials.

2. **Configuration**
   Create a `Config.toml` file in the project root directory with your HubSpot OAuth2 credentials:

   ```toml
   clientId = "<Your Client ID>"
   clientSecret = "<Your Client Secret>"
   refreshToken = "<Your Refresh Token>"
   ```

   > **Note:** Before running this example, ensure you have valid HubSpot object IDs for deals and companies. Update the `FROM_OBJECT_ID` and `TO_OBJECT_ID` constants in `main.bal` with your actual object IDs.

## Run the Example

Execute the following command to run the example. The script will print its progress to the console, showing the results of each association operation.

```shell
bal run
```

The script will perform the following operations in sequence:
1. Create a default association between a deal and a company
2. Create an association with a custom label between the deal and company
3. Read all associations between the deal and company
4. Delete the specific labeled association
5. Read associations after the specific deletion
6. Delete all remaining associations between the deal and company
7. Read associations after deleting all associations
